# Dachande's dotfiles

This is a (WIP) collection of my dotfiles.

The installer script is based on the dotfiles installer created by my collegue [@marcusandre](https://github.com/marcusandre).

Although the installer autodetects the running OS and either installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (on MacOS) or [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh) (on Linux) the dotfiles currently only support Linux and must be modified to work on MacOS.

When asked by the installer where you want to install Linuxbrew, you should select to install it to your home directory `~/.linuxbrew`.
